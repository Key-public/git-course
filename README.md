# Version Control with Git #
## final project ## 
Create a Git repository with the commits shown in the commit graph and table below. This
simulates a team building and releasing a product using the Gitflow workflow. The first release
(v1.00) has only one feature. Soon after release, a bug was discovered and a hotfix (v1.01) was
necessary.
When you are finished, find someone to check your work. They can clone your repository to
check it. Feel free to experiment and good luck!
